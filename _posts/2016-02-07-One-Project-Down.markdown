As before, the three questions:

> 1. What did you do this past week?

> 2. What's in your way?
>
> 3. What will you do next week?

##The week in review

This week went much more smoothly than last week. I managed to get the reading done, for a given definition of the word, and found them helpful. I believe keeping them in mind as we progress into the next project will be important, since I hope to find a partner to pair program with. I especially like the idea of tossing out and rewriting solo work, since in my own individual assignments I have a habit of occasionally starting over from scratch; I find starting back at the beginning helps my better understand my own work, and forces me to better justify my designs.

I finally managed to get some photos taken tonight, though it was rushed and on my phone, not on my DSLR. I bring this up, because it highlights something important: while I would prefer the DSLR, since I had a (self-imposed) deadline I chose a method which would get the task accomplished; by all means, the photo is functional, if not ideal. However, it is also important to note that I am not fully satisfied with this result, and will still be going back for another take with the DSLR when opportunity allows. This can be analogous the difference between writing functional code and efficient code; begin with something that works, but be sure to go back and improve upon it later.

Finally, I wanted to touch on the project. I managed to finish with plenty of time to spare, even after including caches and other optimizations. The most challenging part was discussing ideas with other students, since there's a fine line between sharing a concept and giving away a solution.

##Issues

Since finishing the last project, I've been wanting to start on the next one. Since that won't happen until tomorrow, I cannot begin there.

##Down the road

 - Read the materials.
 - Find a partner and start Project 2.

##Helpful tip of the week

Someone last week mentioned [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/), which I decided to checkout. I would recommend anyone else who has trouble keeping things organized to give it (or something similar) a shot. I might later checkout "If This Then That", [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/); I haven't tried it yet, but it looks like it could be interesting, depending on what I can make it do.
