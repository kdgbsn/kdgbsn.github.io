First thoughts
--------------

Our first day of class, January 20th, 2016, left me with a sense of apprehension and excitement. After hearing about the projects and tools we would be using, the scale of the coming projects seem daunting. Even this blog, an extra credit practice in writing and documentation, appeared heavy with restrictions and requirements, forcing me to learn new and unfamiliar tools.

However, despite (or more accurately, because) of the challenges, I feel excited. In my last degree, anthropology, I felt woefully under prepared to actually pursue a career in the field, and while my CS coursework to date has had a blend of theory and practice, I had little experience with many of the tools I commonly heard about, such as GitHub. To take a course that appears to target that particular shortcoming in education is refreshing, if not downright incredible.

Questions asked, answered
-------------------------

But of course, one of the tasks for this blog is to answer the questions posed weekly by Professor Downing, and for this week, we look at three questions:

> 1. What did you do this past week?
>
> 2. What's in your way?
>
> 3. What will you do next week?

##Things done this week

There's a lot of setup to do for the first project, which is why I would recommend anyone who hasn't started yet to begin soon. To further complicate matters, I decided to undertake this blog, which added some to my workload. As a brief breakdown, so far I have:

- asked for and received a GitHub education account
- learned how to use GitHub's issue tracker, including creating, assigning, commenting, and closing issues
- decided to install Ubuntu alongside Windows on my personal laptop, so I could write this blog, during which I broke Windows, fixed it, broke Ubuntu, fixed that, and finally got everything working (hopefully)
- installed Jekyll, which required RubyGems, which required Ruby, which was installed with RVM, requiring that to be installed, because the version of Ruby supported by apt-get was too old to support Jekyll 3, and I decided that was the version I would use
- played with git and GitHub, to get this blog running
- toyed with several text editors; planned to use vim, but that went out when I found my arrow keys not functioning correctly; emacs fell to unfamiliar hotkeys; settled on Atom for now.


##What's in the way

As the above suggests, there have been several setbacks.

Primarily, time has been the issue. While nothing has appeared as a definitive block, each thing I need to look up, install, and learn about adds up. For the project, I've spent about four hours on set-up and am just ready to look at the code; for this blog, another six hours at the time of writing; and this is not to mention time spent on other tasks, both for this class and other responsibilities.

Regarding this blog, I will need a better photo. After searching all my photos, I realized I don't have any decent photos of myself. For this post, the required photo is hard-coded into the post, but as this is terrible practice, eventually this will need to get folded into the layout of the overall site.

##For next week

- Set up Sphere
- Continue and hopefully finish the project
- Read the materials in the schedule
- Learn more about Jekyll and how to develop a better layout; may set up a different template (this is the Jekyll default) to begin, but want to eventually learn how to design my own
- Do a photo shoot

Closing Thoughts and Tips
-------------------------

Time management is an essential skill. If this class is to develop us as software engineers, as capable employees, then I will need to treat it as a job; including keeping to deadlines and client requests (assignments), while still maintaining a work-life balance.

To that end, start early whenever possible. Just getting things set up took me a lot longer than anticipated, especially since I kept discovering more and more things that needed attention.
