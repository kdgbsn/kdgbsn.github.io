As before, the three questions:

> 1. What did you do this past week?
>
> 2. What's in your way?
>
> 3. What will you do next week?

##The week in review

We began the Netflix project, which includes extra credit for working with a partner; I'm always hesitant to work with someone new for the first time, since I don't know how another person works until after making the commitment to work with them. However, the allure of extra points and a good learning experience pulled me past my hesitation, and I found myself a partner. So far, things have work out well, with us both committing to using pair programming techniques, such as working on the machine.

We both have worked independently on several cache ideas and implementations; however, I would argue that this was still in the spirit of pair programming. The decision to leverage a cache in our solution is only ever made as a pair, and any code written to incorporate a cache into our design is always coded as a pair.

Finally, through another class, I've ended up over on BitBucket as another location for code repos. It uses a different issue tracker, JIRA, which we know is used by many businesses, such as Main Street Hub (per the guest speaker this last week).

##Issues

We ran into a couple of scheduling issues, but managed to commit enough time to the project this last week to get our RMSE across all of probe below 1.00. However, we know there are difficult subsets in probe, so we will need to further refine our algorithm to handle these cases.

We also ran into the disk quota issue a few times, particularly when using a full rating cache to construct more targeted caches.

##Down the road

 - Improve the RMSE on the Netflix project.
 - Develop better cache structures to that end.
 
##Helpful tip of the week

I have limited experience with it, and haven't yet tried to implement it with this assignment (not sure if allowed), but if you're interested in doing data related computations with python, [Python Data Analysis Library - pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) is a good library to look at.
