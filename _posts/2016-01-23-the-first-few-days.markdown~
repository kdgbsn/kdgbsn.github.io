Our first day of class, Janurary 20th, 2016, ended with a sense of apprehension and excitement. After hearing about the projects and tools we would be using, the scale of the coming projects were daunting. Even this blog, an extra credit practice in writing and documentation, appeared heavy with restrictions and requirements, forcing me to learn new and unfamiliar tools.

However, despite (or more likely, because) of the challenges

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
